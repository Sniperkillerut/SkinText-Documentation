Create your own Skin
====================

SkinText has a wide and extensive configuration, here we will go step by step to help you on your way to become a master skinner!

------
Colors
------
All of Skintext's color can be changed to your liking even with transparency (Gradients are planned for a future release)

Overlayed colors will stack/fuse/add if they are semi-transparent

This is for some advanced shapes when radius is set bigger than the actual width of the Text Area, feel free to play with this.

------------------------------
Background Image Configuration
------------------------------
SkinText allows to skin it using images with trasnparency and even GIFs with animation.

*************
GIF Rendering
*************
SkinText can use two methods of rendering/loading Animated GIFs (This does not affect other file formats)

RAM
^^^^
    SkinText will load all the frames of the GIF on RAM, this will reduce the CPU and HDD usage, but will greatly incresease the amount of RAM that SkinText uses, this is recommended only for short/small GIFs or if you don't worry about RAM usage.

CPU
^^^^
    SkinText will load each frame of the GIF from the HDD according to the GIF framerate, this will use both HDD and CPU, these usages are really low but will keep RAM usage far lower than the RAM method, this is recommended for big/long/HD GIFs.

****************
Background Image
****************
Select the Background Image to use on SkinText.

**********************
Clear Background Image
**********************
This button will remove the Background Image.
    :Known Issue:
        If using a GIF with `RAM`_ method, the used memory will not be unloaded until SkinText restart.

*******************
BG Image Blur Value
*******************
Sets the amount of blur to use on the Background Image.

not to be confused with `Window`_ `Blur Background`_

******************
BG Image Blur Type
******************

Box:
^^^^
    A box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is a spatial domain linear filter in which each pixel in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of its neighboring pixels in the input image. [#]_

Gauss:
^^^^^^
    The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen. [#]_

*************
Image Opacity
*************
Sets the Background Image transparency.

notice that 100% will not disable/unload the image, for that use the `Clear Background Image`_ button

------

Sets the Main Window transparency.

**************
Always on Top

*************
